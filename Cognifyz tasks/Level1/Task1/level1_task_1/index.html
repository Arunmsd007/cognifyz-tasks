        <h2><u>About Cloud Computing</u></h2>
        <p> Cloud computing is adopted by every company, whether it is an MNC or a startup many are still migrating towards it because of the cost-cutting, lesser maintenance, and the increased capacity of the data with the help of servers maintained by the cloud providers.
            One more reason for this drastic change from the On-premises servers of the companies to the Cloud providers is the ‘Pay as you go’ principle-based services provided by them i.e., you only have to pay for the service which you are using. The disadvantage On-premises server holds is that if the server is not in use the company still has to pay for it.</p>
